# caddy-underwater-diver-classification
All ML/DL techniques developed and tested against CADDY diver dataset

Actually the software repo for the paper _Underwater Vision-Based Gesture Recognition: Robustness Validation for Safe Human-Robot Interaction_

The most complete model (model-F) has 95% (world class) accuracy.
